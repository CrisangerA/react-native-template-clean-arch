### troubleshoot
The test are made in Linux - Ubuntu 20.04. If you have a problem related with CMAKE as me, You should install this packages: 
- [sudo apt-get install -y libicu-dev](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/72937332/task-reactandroidhermes-engineconfigurebuildforhermes-failed-react-native-new)
- [sudo apt-get install -y build-essential](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6141608/cmake-make-program-not-found)
